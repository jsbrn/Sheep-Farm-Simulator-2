# Sheep Farm Simulator 2.0 (Working Title) #

On a whim I decided to start fresh and redo the original project, Sheep Farm Simulator, to run extremely well and not crash every 30 seconds. Also completely revamping the game mechanics and making it fun for once.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Holding my source code until I am ready to release.

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Pull the project, and import into your favorite IDE (I recommend IntelliJ IDEA).

2. Install slick.jar in lib/ locally (Maven).

3. Make some changes.

4. Use Maven commands or your IDE to build/deploy/run the game. In IntelliJ, the 'install' task can be found in View -> Tool Windows -> Maven.

### What libraries do I need? ###

This game has the following requirements:

1. Java 6 minimum (hopefully)
2. LWJGL 2.9.3
3. Slick2D (unidentified version, included in project; see above)
